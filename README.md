- Supervised Folder  -> uses Keras Library and Tensorflow

(1) Artificial Neural Network -> ANN is implemented through the use of Keras Library and Tensorflow backend. Dataset is obtained through
www.superdatascience.com . Project is based on classification of users accordingly to their tendency to leave the bank.

(2) Convolutional Neural Network -> CNN follows the same pattern as the ANN implementation and dataset is obtained the same way. Project
is based on object detection aspect in which the neural network is trained to differentiate between the photos of dogs and cats. 

(3) Recurrent Neural Network -> RNN uses LSTM ( Long Short-Term Memory ) for the neural network to obtain its main functionality. Project
is based on google stock prediction and uses the dataset to train the neural network every 60 days and predict accordingly. The result
is then plotted using matplotlib to get the visualisation of the graph.

- Unsupervised Folder 

(1) Self-Organizing Map -> SOM uses MiniSom Python file to create a SOM and it is referenced from test.pypi.org. Project involves making two BMUs and gathering potential frauds in a banking database. Hybrid Machine Learning system is also implemented through the use of ANN and SOMs to generate a list of potential frauds with the probability of the frauds happening calculated through ANN.
